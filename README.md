 I Am Poor 💸  

A simple Flutter app inspired by the "I Am Rich" app, but with a humorous twist! This beginner-friendly project helps in understanding Flutter basics, including UI structure, widgets, and asset management.  

 📱 Features  
- Displays a single image of a lump of coal (or any other "poor" symbol).  
- Uses Flutter's `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, and `Image.asset()` widgets.  
- A great practice project for learning Flutter fundamentals.
